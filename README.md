# PES-app
PES (Personalized-estimated segmentation) software application was built using a graphical user interface (GUI) in MATLAB by app designer that offers interactive, user-friendly, and straightforward tools to generate nerve fiber estimate trajectories.

The simplicity of this model specifies that only RGB fundus images and knowledge of selecting properly the ground truth data of the fovea and the optic disk are required as input. The fovea center and the optic disk boundary are selected interactively.
